  The markdown document is converted into HTML and inserted here.
  The poetryBook.js file treats each second-level heading (<h2> tags) in the markdown
  document as a the start of a new page. It wraps <article> tags around those sections
  so that css can use them as positioning and styling hooks. <article> tags have
  id attributes that match their url in the address bar. <img> tags have id attributes
  that are the same as their alt text, but without spaces
