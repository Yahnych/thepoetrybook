*The Poetry Book* is a fast and easy system for quickly making your own book of poems. You can also use it as the basis of building highly interactive websites and apps. If you want to create your own book of poems that looks like this one, [get the source code](http:#) and modify it as much as you like.
 
All the content for the entire book exists as a single markdown document. Markdown documents are quick and easy to read and write, and don't require any technical skill to create. The Poetry Book uses the markdown document to figure out how the website should be organized. This is all done automatically using JavaScript - you don't have to worry about it. Just drop your markdown file into the Poetry Book's home folder, and the navigation bar and content pages will be automatically created. Fill the content pages with anything you like, as much as you like. Drop the Poetry Book project folder into any webserver, and you're done. There's nothing to configure or install, and no complex dependant technologies. It's a new way to think about websites and interactive content using the most basic technologies available.

If you like, you can completely customize the css code to create entirely new and original layouts and designs based on this system. It will work on any platform, anywhere. There is only one content file, so it's extremely easy to manage and displays pages instantly. If you keep things simple, this might be all you need to build a small to medium-sized personal website or focused app.
  
Or, just make a poetry book.

Why The Poetry Book is cool:

- All the content exists as a single, easy-to-read markdown file.
- There are no moving parts, so nothing can break.
- Content pages display instantly because they all exist in that single file. The browser doesn't need to make continual http requests to a server for each page.
- You can manage the entire website offline, without needing a CMS, database or web server. You can do it in Notepad.
- Minimal, uncluttered content management using markdown so that it's extremely easy to add and customize content by hand. Just use your text editor's search capability (Ctrl-F) to find what you're looking for.
- When you want to update your website content, just upload the single markdown file with FTP.
- Use this same code as the foundation for building a mobile app (with [CocoonJS](http://www.ludei.com/tech/cocoonjs)), or a desktop app (with [node-webkit](https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit/wiki/Getting-Started-with-node-webkit)).
- Completely transportable. Just drop the same files into any webserver anywhere, and it will work exactly the same without any configuration or installation. Keep your whole website in your back pocket.
- Low-tech, high-performance, and extremely easy to maintain.
- Less is more!
