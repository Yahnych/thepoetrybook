<h1>The Poetry Book</h1>  
  
<article category="what?">
<h2>What is The Poetry Book?</h2>
<p>
<em>The Poetry Book</em> is a fast and easy
system for quickly building highly interactive websites
and apps.
If you want to make a website or application that works like this one, 
<a href:"#">get the source code</a> and modify it as much as you like.
<p>  
All the content exists on a single html page
using the least possible markup. It's completely self-organizing using
JavaScript. Just drop your own content to the HTML page, and the
navigation bar and content pages will be automatically created.
Fill the content pages with anything you like, as much as you like.
It's a new way to think about websites and interactive content using the most basic technology available: plain old html.
<p>
Customize the css code to create completely new and original
layouts and designs based on this system. 
It will work on any platform. There is only one content file, so it's extremely easy to manage and displays pages instantly.
If you keep things simple, 
this might be all you need to build a small to medium-sized personal
website or focused app.
<p>  
Or, just make a poetry book.
  
<h3>What do you need to know?</h3>
<p>
At minimum, you should know some basic HTML and CSS.
If you don't know what those things are, you should learn them first.
(There are many resources on the internet that will help you do this. Doing a web search for "HTML and CSS tutorial" is a good place to start. The first chapter of <a href = "http://www.apress.com/programming/javascript/9781430247166" target="_blank">this book</a> is also really good).
You need to know HTML and CSS basics so that you can add content, understand how the files work together, and upload your
own poetry book onto a web server.
Then you can start customizing things like the fonts, colors and layout.
<p>
For HTML and CSS experts, go wild!
This project was intended as the simplest, bare-bones example of a new vision of what highly interactive websites and apps could be. 
<p>Perhaps it's more than that: it's a manifesto. What if all websites were like this?
Rip it apart, rebuild it, improve it, and make the web a better place.
  
<h3>How to make your own book</h3>

<p>Use this format to create new content pages in the html source:
<p>
<!-- html source -->
&lt;article  category="category name"&gt;<br />
&lt;h2&gt;Name of the content page&lt;/h2&gt;<br />
... insert any ordinary html content...<br />
&lt;/article&gt;
<p> 
That's all you need to do.
<p>
All the content inside an article element will display as its own page.
The <em>category</em> attribute is used to create the navigation bar headings you see on the left.
The JavaScript code creates the navigation bar dynamically based on
these category headings, and uses them to organize the content links.
<p>
The categories will be ordered alphabetically. 
To change that, you'll need to change the JavaScript code in the 
poetryBook.js file. If that's something you're confident doing, go for it! 
But, if you don't fight it, you'll discover
that's it's really nice just to have the system organize your content for you like this.
It's just one less decision you need to make, and you can make it work for you. 
Spend the extra time you saved to write some poetry.
<p>
If you don't include a category, the article will appear at the very top of the
navigation bar, above the all the categorized articles.
<p>A useful feature is that the first article on the HTML page, will also be the first to be
displayed when the page loads. That means if you want viewers to see the newest content first,
just add it as the first article on the page.
<p>
If you want to link a content page to another page in the book you can <a href="#SongsofthePixies">do it like this</a>:
<p>
&lt;a href="#SongsofthePixies"&gt;do it like this&lt;/a&gt;
  
<h3>Start making it</h3>
<p>
To start making your own Poetry Book visit the source code archive:
<p>
<a href:"#">Test</a>
<p>
just modify the poetryBook.html file with your own content.
(Yes, that's the very same file you're reading right now.) 
Or, start with a completely new, empty poetry book by adding content to the newPoetryBook.html file.

<h3>Why its cool</h3>

<ul>
<li>An entire website exists on a single, simple html page.</li>   
<li>Content pages display instantly because they already exist in that single file. The browser doesn't need to make continual http requests to a server for each page.</li>
<li>You can manage the entire website offline, without needing a CMS or web server. You can do it in Notepad.</li>
<li>Minimal, uncluttered html markup so that it's extremely easy to add and customize content by hand. Just use your source code editor's search capability (Ctrl-F) to find what you're looking for.</li>
<li>When you want to update your website content, just upload the single html file with FTP.</li>
<li>Use this same code as the foundation for building a mobile app, or a desktop app with node-webkit.</li>
<li>Low-tech, high-performance, and extremely easy to maintain.</li>
<li>Less is more!</li>
</ul>

<h2>Infant Sorrow</h2>
<p>
My mother groaned, my father wept,<br>
Into the dangerous world I leapt;<br>
Helpless, naked, piping loud,<br>
Like a fiend hid in a cloud.<br>

Struggling in my father's hands,<br>
Striving against my swaddling bands,<br>
Bound and weary, I thought best<br>
To sulk upon my mother's breast.<br>
  
<p><em>William Blake</em>

<h2>Auguries of Innocence</h2>
<p>
To see a world in a grain of sand,<br>
And a heaven in a wild flower,<br>
Hold infinity in the palm of your hand,<br>	
And eternity in an hour.<br>
  
<p><em>William Blake</em>
</article>
  
<article  category="rilke">
<h2>The Panther</h2>
<p>
His vision, from the constantly passing bars,<br>
has grown so weary that it cannot hold<br>
anything else. It seems to him there are<br>
a thousand bars; and behind the bars, no world.<br>
<p>
As he paces in cramped circles, over and over,<br>
the movement of his powerful soft strides<br>
is like a ritual dance around a center<br>
in which a mighty will stands paralyzed.<br>
<p>
Only at times, the curtain of the pupils<br>
lifts, quietly. An image enters in,<br>
rushes down through the tensed, arrested muscles,<br>
plunges into the heart and is gone.<br>
  
<p><em>Rainer Maria Rilke</em>

<h2>Evening</h2>
<p>
The bleak fields are asleep,<br>
My heart alone wakes.<br>
The evening in the harbour<br>
Down his red sails takes.<br>
<p>
Night, guardian of dreams,<br>
Now wanders through the land.<br>
The moon, a lily white,<br>
Blossoms within her hand.<br>
  
<p><em>Rainer Maria Rilke</em>

<h2>Kubla Khan</h2>
<p>
In Xanadu did Kubla Khan<br>
A stately pleasure-dome decree:<br>
Where Alph, the sacred river, ran<br>
Through caverns measureless to man<br>
Down to a sunless sea.<br>
So twice five miles of fertile ground<br>
With walls and towers were girdled round;<br>
And there were gardens bright with sinuous rills,<br>
Where blossomed many an incense-bearing tree;<br>
And here were forests ancient as the hills,<br>
Enfolding sunny spots of greenery.<br>
<p>
But oh! that deep romantic chasm which slanted<br>
Down the green hill athwart a cedarn cover!<br>
A savage place! as holy and enchanted<br>
As e’er beneath a waning moon was haunted<br>
By woman wailing for her demon-lover!<br>
And from this chasm, with ceaseless turmoil seething,<br>
As if this earth in fast thick pants were breathing,<br>
A mighty fountain momently was forced:<br>
Amid whose swift half-intermitted burst<br>
Huge fragments vaulted like rebounding hail,<br>
Or chaffy grain beneath the thresher’s flail:<br>
And mid these dancing rocks at once and ever<br>
It flung up momently the sacred river.<br>
Five miles meandering with a mazy motion<br>
Through wood and dale the sacred river ran,<br>
Then reached the caverns measureless to man,<br>
And sank in tumult to a lifeless ocean;<br>
And ’mid this tumult Kubla heard from far<br>
Ancestral voices prophesying war!<br>
The shadow of the dome of pleasure<br>
Floated midway on the waves;<br>
Where was heard the mingled measure<br>
From the fountain and the caves.<br>
It was a miracle of rare device,<br>
A sunny pleasure-dome with caves of ice!<br>
<p>
A damsel with a dulcimer<br>
In a vision once I saw:<br>
It was an Abyssinian maid<br>
And on her dulcimer she played,<br>
Singing of Mount Abora.<br>
Could I revive within me<br>
Her symphony and song,<br>
To such a deep delight ’twould win me,<br>
That with music loud and long,<br>
I would build that dome in air,<br>
That sunny dome! those caves of ice!<br>
And all who heard should see them there,<br>
And all should cry, Beware! Beware!<br>
His flashing eyes, his floating hair!<br>
Weave a circle round him thrice,<br>
And close your eyes with holy dread<br>
For he on honey-dew hath fed,<br>
And drunk the milk of Paradise.<br>

<h2>Songs of the Pixies</h2>
<p>
I.<br>
Whom the untaught Shepherds call<br>
Pixies in their madrigal,<br>
Fancy's children, here we dwell:<br>
Welcome, Ladies! to our cell.<br>
Here the wren of softest note<br>
Builds its nest and warbles well;<br>
Here the blackbird strains his throat;<br>
Welcome, Ladies! to our cell.<br>
<p>
II.<br>
When fades the moon to shadowy-pale,<br>
And scuds the cloud before the gale,<br>
Ere the Morn, all gem-bedight,<br>
Hath streak'd the East with rosy light,<br>
We sip the furze-flower's fragrant dews<br>
Clad in robes of rainbow hues:<br>
Or sport amid the shooting gleams<br>
To the tune of distant-tinkling teams,<br>
While lusty Labour scouting sorrow<br>
Bids the Dame a glad good-morrow,<br>
Who jogs the accustomed road along,<br>
And paces cheery to her cheering song.<br>
<p>
III.<br>
But not our filmy pinion<br>
We scorch amid the blaze of day,<br>
When Noontide's fiery-tressed minion<br>
Flashes the fervid ray.<br>
Aye from the sultry heat<br>
We to the cave retreat<br>
O'ercanopied by huge roots intertwined<br>
With wildest texture, blackened o'er with age:<br>
Round them their mantle green the ivies bind,<br>
Beneath whose foliage pale<br>
Fanned by the unfrequent gale<br>
We shield us from the Tyrant's mid-day rage.<br>
<p>
IV.<br>
Thither, while the murmuring throng<br>
Of wild-bees hum their drowsy song,<br>
By Indolence and Fancy brought,<br>
A youthful Bard, 'unknown to Fame',<br>
Wooes the Queen of Solemn Thought,<br>
And heaves the gentle misery of a sigh,<br>
Gazing with tearful eye,<br>
As round our sandy grot appear<br>
Many a rudely sculptured name<br>
To pensive Memory dear!<br>
Weaving gay dreams of sunny-tinctured hue<br>
We glance before his view:<br>
O'er his hush'd soul our soothing witcheries shed<br>
And twine the future garland round his head.<br>
<p>
V.<br>
When Evening's dusky car<br>
Crowned with her dewy star<br>
Steals o'er the fading sky in shadowy flight;<br>
On leaves of aspen trees<br>
We tremble to the breeze<br>
Veiled from the grosser ken of mortal sight.<br>
Or, haply, at the visionary hour,<br>
Along our wildly-bowered sequestered walk,<br>
We listen to the enamoured rustic's talk;<br>
Heave with the heavings of the maiden's breast,<br>
Where young-eyed Loves have hid their turtle nest;<br>
Or guide of soul-subduing power<br>
The glance, that from the half-confessing eye<br>
Darts the fond question or the soft reply.<br>
<p>
VI.<br>
Or through the mystic ringlets of the vale<br>
We flash our faery feet in gamesome prank;<br>
Or, silent-sandal'd, pay our defter court,<br>
Circling the Spirit of the Western Gale,<br>
Where wearied with his flower-caressing sport,<br>
Supine he slumbers on a violet bank;<br>
Then with quaint music hymn the parting gleam<br>
By lonely Otter's sleep-persuading stream;<br>
Or where his wave with loud unquiet song<br>
Dashed o'er the rocky channel froths along;<br>
Or where, his silver waters smoothed to rest,<br>
The tall tree's shadow sleeps upon his breast.<br>
<p>
VII.<br>
Hence thou lingerer, Light!<br>
Eve saddens into Night.<br>
Mother of wildly-working dreams! we view<br>
The sombre hours, that round thee stand<br>
With down-cast eyes (a duteous band!)<br>
Their dark robes dripping with the heavy dew.<br>
Sorceress of the ebon throne!<br>
Thy power the Pixies own,<br>
When round thy raven brow<br>
Heaven's lucent roses glow,<br>
And clouds in watery colours drest<br>
Float in light drapery o'er thy sable vest:<br>
What time the pale moon sheds a softer day<br>
Mellowing the woods beneath its pensive beam:<br>
For mid the quivering light 'tis ours to play,<br>
Aye dancing to the cadence of the stream.<br>
<p>
VIII.<br>
Welcome, Ladies! to the cell<br>
Where the blameless Pixies dwell:<br>
But thou, sweet Nymph! proclaimed our Faery Queen,<br>
With what obeisance meet<br>
Thy presence shall we greet?<br>
For lo! attendant on thy steps are seen<br>
Graceful Ease in artless stole,<br>
And white-robed Purity of soul,<br>
With Honour's softer mien;<br>
Mirth of the loosely-flowing hair,<br>
And meek-eyed Pity eloquently fair,<br>
Whose tearful cheeks are lovely to the view,<br>
As snow-drop wet with dew.<br>
<p>
IX.<br>
Unboastful Maid! though now the Lily pale<br>
Transparent grace thy beauties meek;<br>
Yet ere again along the impurpling vale,<br>
The purpling vale and elfin-haunted grove,<br>
Young Zephyr his fresh flowers profusely throws,<br>
We'll tinge with livelier hues thy cheek;<br>
And, haply, from the nectar-breathing Rose<br>
Extract a Blush for Love!<br>
