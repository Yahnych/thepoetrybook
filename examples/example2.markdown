Yay, Poems!
===========

<h2 category="boring">The Swan</h2>

It just sits there.  
And stares.

*by Me*

<h2 category="fun">Windmill</h2>

Dangerously close,  
the incisive blades,  
grist the seeds of time,  
for our decapitated fore-fathers.  

*Also by me*

<h2 category="fun">Autumn</h2>

Leaves fall,
As do,
Heavy books on my toe.

*Yes, this one is by me too*
