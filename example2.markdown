Yay, Poems!
===========

The Swan [boring]
-----------------

It just sits there.  
And stares.

*by Me*

Windmill [fun]
--------------
Dangerously close,  
the incisive blades,  
grist the seeds of time,  
for our decapitated fore-fathers.  

*Also by me*

Autumn [fun]
------------

Leaves fall,
As do,
Heavy books on my toe.

*Yes, this one is by me too*
